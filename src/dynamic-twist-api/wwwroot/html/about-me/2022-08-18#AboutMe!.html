<h2>About me!</h2><p>Hi!</p><p>My name is Pavle. I am primarily a backend engineer with my strongest point being .NET. But I like to dabble in a lot of different stuff (CI/CD, Nginx, Golang, Cloud providers, System Design, â€¦).</p><p>Here I will write about any new and interesting details that gave me an AHA moment. More specifically, the fun stuff. :)</p><p>Essentially, this is my little dev journal.</p><p>Hope you enjoy!</p>
